# Which continent has sold more?

This is a project that has been designed by myself.After reveiwing portfolios and projects of Github users I found out that I should make a project. Then, I downloaded a pre-prepared database with alot of tables from Microsoft website.The prgoram used for analysis is Azure Data Studio.At the fist stage, I needed to know which continent has sold more. Therefore, I create a new table by joining three tables together to gain the data through the following written code:

After creating a table, I pulled some data from it through count,sum and round :

Then, the following table has been returned.
